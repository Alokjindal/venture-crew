## Images
**Hero Image**: Large, full-viewport hero featuring GNDEC students on an adventure (trekking mountain trail or gathered around sunset campfire). Image should convey camaraderie, adventure, and the natural beauty of outdoor exploration.

**Additional Images**:
- About page: Founder Alok Jindal leading a group activity

**Image Treatment**: All images use subtle overlays when text is present, with hero images having gradient overlays (bottom to top, from charcoal 60% opacity to transparent) to ensure text readability.

## Key Design Principles
1. **Adventure-Forward**: Every design element should evoke outdoor exploration and community
2. **Trust & Safety**: Professional presentation to reassure parents and faculty
3. **Mobile-First**: Optimized for student mobile usage patterns
4. **Accessibility**: High contrast ratios and clear navigation for all users
5. **Performance**: Lazy-loaded images and optimized assets for fast loading

## Visual Hierarchy

- Content sections: Clear type hierarchy with Lora body text
- Call-to-action emphasis through strategic orange color placement
- Consistent card-based layouts for trip listings and blog posts

The design balances the excitement of outdoor adventure with the credibility needed for institutional support, creating a cohesive brand experience that appeals to students while building confidence with faculty and potential sponsors.
