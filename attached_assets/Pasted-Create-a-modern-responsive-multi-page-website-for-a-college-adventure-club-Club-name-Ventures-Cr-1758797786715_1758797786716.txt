Create a modern, responsive multi-page website for a college adventure club:

Club name: Ventures Crew
Tagline: Dare. Discover. Do.

Tone: energetic, trustworthy, community-first. Target audience: GNDEC students (18–24), faculty, and sponsors.

Required pages & features:

- About (mission, vision, founder: Alok Jindal, GNDEC)
- Trips & Events (upcoming trips with calendar, RSVP/registration button)
- Blog (CMS-style, list + article pages)
- Gallery (photo grid, lightbox)
- Join / Membership (form with Name, Email, Phone, Year, Dept, Emergency contact, Experience level, Consent to waiver)
- Safety & Gear (mandatory safety info, basic checklist)
- For Faculty & Sponsors (pitch + benefits)
- Contact (contact form + email + placeholder phone + campus map)
- Footer: social links, newsletter signup, quick links, privacy/waiver link.

Design & UI:
- Hero: full-bleed outdoor image (students trekking or sunset campfire), big headline, CTA.
- Palette: bold outdoor colors (eg. #0f4c5c deep teal, #ff7a00 orange accent, #f5f7f9 off-white, #222222 charcoal).
- Fonts: Montserrat (headlines) + Lora (body) or Google equivalents.
- Mobile-first, accessible (a11y), fast-loading images, lazy-loading.

Content to seed:
- About copy, 3 blog posts (see below), safety waiver template, 10 gallery image prompts and alt text.
- SEO: title template "Ventures Crew | GNDEC Adventure Club", meta description, OG image.

Extra features:
- Integrate newsletter (Mailchimp) and analytics (Google Analytics).
- Add social share buttons, event RSVP system, downloadable waiver PDF, admin panel to add posts/events.
- Include "Faculty/Advisor" contact form and button to download a one-page pitch PDF.
